# stock_Analysis

## Overview:
Steve is helping his parents who have decided to invest all of their savings in a renewable energy company called DAQO New Energy Corporation. His parents did not do any research before choosing DAQO and this makes Steve concerned about diversifying his parents funds.

## Purpose of Analysis:
Steve needs help to analyse a big list of renewable energy companies stocks from the stock market (including DAQO) over the years 2017 and 2018. This will help his parents decide wether investing in DAQO would be a good decision or not and which renewable energy company stocks would be a more profitable option based on the analysis.

## Results:

### Stock performance comparison between the year 2017 and 2018:

#### DQ Stock performance: 
In the year 2017 DQ stock performace demonstrated a growth of almost 199% making it at a glance the best stock to invest in that year however; that is not the case when comparing it to the year 2018 where the stock return dropped 62% making it a bad choice for Steve's parents to invest in as shown in the images below.

Therefore, comparing stock performance over the years is definetly a more relaiable method to identify trends and demonstrate performance of a given stock.

#### Other Stock Performance:
As shown in the images below both ENPH and RUN stocks have done quite well in the year 2017 & continued to grow in the year 2018 with a return growth of almost 82% and 84% respectively. They are also the top traded stocks in the year 2018.

Investing in those two stocks would be a better decision for Steves parents as they will diversify their funds and invest in more profitable stocks.

## Summary

### Advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code

#### Advantages: 
Refactoring helps use code in a more efficient and effective way. In this challenge we refactered code by ading a loop that goes through a huge list of stock data row by row and Collects volume, starting price and ending price and storing them in arrays. This process not only saves alot of time but also enables you to showcase outputs in a way that is convenient and helps make the correct decision. 

#### Disadvantages:
Refactered code can become very hard to debug especially with more complex analysis and therefore fixing errors will be verytricky.

### Advantages and disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA script:
It was very helpful to refactor the code from module two, it not only reduced the time for the whole analysis to be done but also loops through the whole data set once and fetches infromation related to the ticker using index and stores it in arrays.
However, when i did come across an error it took me far more time to identify the problem than to refactor the original code. Therefore, refatoring code is definatly a powerful tool, however keeping it clean, structured, with notes and following best practices is as import.
